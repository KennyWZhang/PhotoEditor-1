# PhotoEditor
This enables to use photo editor which is similar to editor given to you by UIImagePickerController

In iOS if you want to edit an image you have to use UIImagePickerController Class which provide you with allowediting option.

However IOS allows you to use UIImagePickerController if your image Source is either PhotoLibrary,SavedAlbum,Camera
If the image Source differs from any of the above mentioned sources you have to create your editing View.This arises if the image is downloaded from the internet and you have to edit the image as per your convenience.

The following written code will enable you to create an editing with regular zoom in and zoom out feature.It reduces your burden to write
down the code for editing screen

Even a shaded screen ensures that the user can edit the image as per choice.

If you are using the codes please use the delegates of PhotoEditView in similar way the delegate of ImagePickerController is used.

With all regards you can contribute for improvement of this code.Thanks for your valuable response.
